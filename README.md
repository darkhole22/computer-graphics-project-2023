# Computer Graphics Project 2023

This repository contains the final project developed for the **Computer Graphics** course (2023 Ed.) at **Politecnico di Milano**.

## Vulture

Vulture is our toy game engine written on top of **Vulkan**.

## Robot Survivor

**Robot Survivor** is a first person shooter in which you have to survive incoming waves of enemy robots on an alien planet.

By destroying enemies, you can level up and obtain random upgrades to help you live longer!

Walking around the procedurally generated world, you'll be able to find powerful *pick-ups*!
